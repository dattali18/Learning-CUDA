# cuFFT

In this section we will explore the cuFFT library, which is a GPU-accelerated FFT library provided by NVIDIA. We will start by discussing the cuFFT library and its features. We will then move on to a simple example that demonstrates how to use the cuFFT library to perform a 1D FFT on the GPU. Finally, we will discuss some of the advanced features of the cuFFT library, such as batched FFTs and multi-GPU support.

We will understand the function given to us by the library how to use them and what are the different parameters that we can pass to the function to get the desired output.

We will also see how to handle the different errors that can occur while using the library and how to handle them.
