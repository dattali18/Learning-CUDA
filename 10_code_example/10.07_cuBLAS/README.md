# cuBLAS

In this section we will explore the cuBLAS library, which is a GPU accelerated library for linear algebra operations. cuBLAS is part of the CUDA toolkit and provides a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) library. cuBLAS is optimized for NVIDIA GPUs and provides routines for operations such as matrix multiplication, matrix addition, and matrix inversion.

We will understand how to use it how to handle errors etc.
